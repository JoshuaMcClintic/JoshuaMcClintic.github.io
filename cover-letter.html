                            My name is Joshua McClintic. I am an undergrad at Western Governor's University currently working toward a Data Analytics degree. 
                            Currently, I have completed classes for <mark>SQL, Python, and Microsoft Excel</mark>, as well as general data management and academic classes. 
                            I believe that, after careful consideration, you will find that I am more than qualified for the position.

                            I am excited to be applying to the <strong>[JOB TITLE]</strong> position at <strong>[COMPANY NAME]</strong>, as I have always held an interest 
                            in <strong>[COMPANY FIELD]</strong>. Over the years, through personal research and my time at WGU, I have learned a great deal of 
                            <strong>[CORE JOB SKILLS]</strong>, and I intend to keep learning more. I am also familiar with <strong>[PREFERRED SKILLS]</strong>, and though 
                            they may not be my strongest skills, I believe I will be able to keep up with the work I'm given.
